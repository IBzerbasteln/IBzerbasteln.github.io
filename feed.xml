It was the most visible fossil repatriation controversy in recent years, featuring strong opinions, overwhelming public engagement under the #UbirajaraBelongstoBR, and the involvement of diplomatic channels. Right after the return of “<em>Ubirajara jubatus</em>” to Brazil, another controversy broke. This one concerned the holotype of <em>Irritator challengeri</em>, another Brazilian dinosaur, housed in another German museum. Scientists and the general public pushed for its return under the #IrritatorBelongstoBR—but the fossil remains in Germany to this day.

In it, we highlighted our legal and ethical concerns and recommended a systematic review of the provenance of the Brazilian fossils in state collections and their legal acquisition.</p> <p>Within a few weeks, 263 professionals from the field of palaeontology and 1,657 members of the general public signed our letter. Brazilian media <a href="https://tr.ee/y343HH6Pw3">reported</a> extensively about it. On 18 September 2023, we submitted the letter to the Ministry. A spokesperson replied on 18 October 2023, informing us that the Ministry was conducting a comprehensive legal assessment of the case (under consideration of our concerns).</p> <h2 id="irritatorbelongstobr-reloaded">#IrritatorBelongstoBR reloaded</h2> <p>I do not know whether anything has happened ever since; to my knowledge, there is no publicly available information that we’ve moved any closer to a return of the holotype. It seems like Aline Ghilardi has had enough of this inertia: on 6 April 2025, she launched a <strong>new social media campaign</strong>. Her posts are spreading awareness for the case of <em>Irritator challengeri</em> and the decolonisation of palaeontology and science in general. In addition, she’s calling people on Twitter, Instagram, and Bluesky to action and invites them to:</p> <ul> <li>Share her thread</li> <li>Use the hashtag #IrritatorBelongsToBR</li> <li>Create protest art and videos</li> <li>Talk about the case on social media</li> <li>Comment on the museum’s social media accounts</li> </ul> <p>I very much resonate with the goals of the campaign and firmly <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/p-stewens.bsky.social/post/3lm6gak4jac2s">support</a> it. Moreover, I am glad that its focus has shifted slightly away from the SMNS, and more towards the Ministry and the government of Baden-Württemberg. The first person to suggest this (to my knowledge) was <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/skyemcdavid.com/post/3lm6vbv5yxk25">Skye McDavid</a>, and I think targeting the Ministry instead of the SMNS holds a lot of potential for legal reasons.</p> <p>The holotype of <em>Irritator challengeri</em> forms part of the collection of a public institution, which makes it national cultural property within the meaning of <a href="https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_kgsg/englisch_kgsg.html#p0073">Section 6, paragraph 2</a> of Germany’s Cultural Property Protection Act. As a consequence, it cannot be exported without a license (<a href="https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_kgsg/englisch_kgsg.html#p0183">Section 23, paragraph 2</a>), and doing so nonetheless can be punished with a fine or up to five years’ imprisonment (<a href="https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_kgsg/englisch_kgsg.html#p0557">Section 83, paragraph 1, no. 1</a>). Admittedly, I don’t think that the museum actually owns the fossil (because it did not acquire good title to it)<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> so these provisions do not apply in my opinion. However, that doesn’t change how the SMNS and Ministry see things, and I assume they consider a license necessary for the permanent export of the fossil. Therefore, the Ministry is the place where a decision on the return of the fossil will have to be made. Here, the Ministry can also overrule the museum; it did so with respect to the fossil of “<em>Ubirajara jubatus</em>” which the <em>Staatliches Museum für Naturkunde Stuttgart</em> had been reluctant to <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/it-s-second-extinction-retraction-deepens-legal-and-ethical-battle-over-rare-dinosaur">repatriate</a>. This is not to put words in the mouth of the SMNS (which, to my knowledge, has not made public statements about the repatriation request) but to underline that the pressure should be put on the institution that is actually calling the shots.</p> <h2 id="decolonisation-and-equity-in-science">Decolonisation and equity in science</h2> <p>I believe that the return of scientific specimens to their territories of origin, if so requested, is an essential component of decolonising science. Repatriation is tangible, material, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decolonization_Is_Not_a_Metaphor">not just a metaphor</a>. It promotes equity in the distribution of what I call secondary benefits derived from scientific materials. As opposed to the primary benefits, namely, scientific knowledge which, in principle, benefits everyone equally,<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> the secondary benefits relate to things like:</p> <ul> <li>the scientific reputation for an institution or scientist(s) that comes with the publication of their findings;</li> <li>the reputation and revenue for those museums that get to display the materials;</li> <li>the revenue from tourism associated with the natural heritage of a given region;</li> <li>the opportunity to engage a local public and train scientists using high-quality resources;</li> <li>etc.</li> </ul> <p>Obtaining these benefits requires physical access to the scientific materials, which is, in principle, zero-sum: only one entity can have it at a time. Therefore, as a function of the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-021-01608-8">highly uneven global distribution of, for example, the fossil record</a>, these secondary benefits are just as unevenly distributed. Put differently, if charismatic Brazilian fossils are in Germany, it is only German institutions and locally-based researchers who benefit from them, and I do not think that this is just. That many of these fossils have made their way into collections abroad in violation of Brazilian law only adds a layer of illegality onto a deeply unethical status quo. This needs to change.</p> <hr/> <div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes"> <ol> <li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote"> <p>For a detailed reasoning in support of this assumption please consider <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-journal-of-cultural-property/article/ubirajara-and-irritator-belong-to-brazil-achieving-fossil-returns-under-german-private-law/816DF6AE097FA871CEA51F5A0FC8821F">my article</a>. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p> </li> <li id="fn:2" role="doc-endnote"> <p>That is, if we assume, and this is a strong assumption, that the knowledge is being made accessible to everyone. <a href="#fnref:2" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p> </li> </ol> </div>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="fossil-law"/><category term="fossil-trafficking"/><category term="fossil-restitution"/><category term="Brazil"/><category term="Germany"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's a new social media campaign for the return of Irritator challengeri - and it's high time German institutions listened.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Was Xenodens calminechari described from a fake fossil?</title><link href="https://paul-stewens.com/blog/2025/xenodens/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Was Xenodens calminechari described from a fake fossil?"/><published>2025-03-19T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-03-19T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://paul-stewens.com/blog/2025/xenodens</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://paul-stewens.com/blog/2025/xenodens/"><![CDATA[<p>Humans have been taking an interest in fossils for a long time—perhaps since the days of the <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2571-550X/7/4/49">Neanderthals</a>. Ever since the interest of more and more people in owning a piece of the deep past gave rise to a market for fossils in the early 19th century, <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-14084-6_5">fakes and forgeries</a> have been circulating among authentic specimens. The earliest historical evidence <a href="https://doi.org/10.3301/ROL.2021.14" title="10.3301/ROL.2021.14">documents</a> fossil forgery in Verona (Italy) in 1827. With the boom of the fossil market in recent decades and especially recent years, the commercial incentive to manipulate specimens to fetch higher prices at mineral shows or auctions has never been higher.</p> <p>Palaeontologists have long <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/35008237">recognised</a> such practices as harmful to science—and linked it to the issue of <a href="/projects/illicit-fossil-trafficking/">illicit fossil trafficking</a>. And yet, instances continue to be reported where specimens of at least doubtful provenance turn out to have been tampered with. The lastest example: <em>Xenodens calminechari</em>.</p> <h2 id="a-new-strangely-toothed-mosasaur">A new, strangely-toothed mosasaur</h2> <div class="row justify-content-sm-center"> <div class="col-sm-7 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <p>In 2021, <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenodens">X. calminechari</a></i> was <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cretres.2021.104764">described</a> as a new genus and species of mosasaurid from the upper Maastrichtian of Morocco. The authors, under the lead of <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06764-9">Nicholas Longrich</a>, named the genus after the type specimen's most striking feature: its strange teeth. <i>X. calminechari</i> had highly unusual, shark-like teeth, which was something never before seen in other mosasaur species and even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamata">squamates</a> and tetrapods in general. Furthermore, the authors declared that the fossil of the type specimen had come out of the Sidi Chennane phosphate mine and "was collected by locals working in the mines, rather than by paleontologists, complicating attempts to constrain stratigraphy and provenance." The fossils are kept in the collections of the <i>Muséum d’Histoire naturelle de Marrakech</i>.</p> </div> <div class="col-sm-5 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/xenodens-maxilla-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/xenodens-maxilla-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/xenodens-maxilla-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/xenodens-maxilla.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" alt="Left maxilla of the mosasaurid Xenodens calminechari, late Maastrichtian of Sidi Chennane, Morocco." title="NickLongrich, CC BY-SA 4.0 &lt;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0&gt;, via Wikimedia Commons" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <h2 id="not-a-new-strangely-toothed-mosasaur">Not a new, strangely-toothed mosasaur?</h2> <p>The authenticity of the specimen was <a href="https://www.livescience.com/animals/extinct-species/red-flags-raised-over-ancient-sea-monster-pulled-from-moroccan-mine">challenged</a> on 16 December 2024 when a group of researchers published a reassessment of the holotype specimen. One of the authors was Michael Caldwell who already lead <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/14772019.2021.1983044">another reassessment study</a> in 2021, that time for the fossil of <em>Tetradophis amplectus</em>, an alleged four-legged snake which had been smuggled from Brazil. Together with his co-authors, he suggests that the holotype of <em>X. calminechari</em> had been manipulated, and possibly wrongly interpreted as well.</p> <p>It was the dentition which made them suspicious. Longrich et al. (2021) had reported that four teeth seem to have only two roots. The authors of the reassessment study suggest, however, that the teeth have been glued in place. Since they were not given access to the holotype, they used different fossils which are known to be forgeries to demonstrate how a CT scan can determine whether adhesive was used. They also encourage Longrich et al. to perform such an analysis. This, the authors emphasise, is even more necessary in light of the provenance of the holotype specimen.</p> <p>Moreover, the authors suggest that <em>X. calminechari</em> might not be a new genus and species after all but rather a juvenile form of another mosasaur (perhaps <em>Carinodens</em>).<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> Its teeth had been its more striking feature when <em>X. calminechari</em> was described in 2021 but Longrich et al. might have insufficiently considered how much the teeth of lizards can vary even within the same species. In their view, <em>X. calminechari</em> is a <em>nomen dubium</em>, i.e., a scientific name of uncertain validity.</p> <h2 id="legal-and-ethical-concerns">Legal and ethical concerns</h2> <p>The case of <em>X. calminechari</em> brings together different aspects that are currently not going right in palaeontology: the lack of care about the legal provenance of fossils, the access to specimens, and the description of new species even from insufficient materials.</p> <h3 id="legal-fossil-collection-and-due-diligence-in-publishing">Legal fossil collection and due diligence in publishing</h3> <p>First, there are pressing legal questions which nobody in the publication process for the description of the new species seems to have bothered to address. Admittedly, the frequent issue of illicit trafficking does not concern us here since the fossil remains in its country of origin. However, Article 116 of Morocco’s <a href="https://www.mem.gov.ma/Lists/Lst_Textes_Reglementaires/Attachments/174/Loi%2033.13%20sur%20les%20Mines%20%20francais.pdf">2015 Mining Code</a> provides that fossils may only be collected and commercialised with a permit.</p> <blockquote> <p>Therefore, it is entirely unclear whether the fossil of <em>X. calminechari</em> was obtained in compliance with the <strong>legal requirements</strong> of the Mining Code.</p> </blockquote> <p>This does not seem to have bothered the authors but neither the reviewers nor the editors of the study appear to have done their due diligence regarding the legal provenance of the studied material.</p> <h3 id="fossil-access-and-reproducibility">Fossil access and reproducibility</h3> <p>Second, the case raises concerns about access to scientific materials and, ultimately, reproducibility. This is a <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5244822/">core pillar</a> of good science: researchers need to be able to run the same tests as their colleagues to determine whether they come to the same result. To that end, access to scientific data is crucial. In the context of studies on physical fossil material the imperative of reproducibility will in many cases demand physical access to specimens, and the reassessment study is precisely such an example: its authors could only have performed the CT scan which they consider necessary on the actual specimen. That Longrich et al. did not make this possible for them, <a href="https://www.livescience.com/animals/extinct-species/red-flags-raised-over-ancient-sea-monster-pulled-from-moroccan-mine">seemingly</a> without giving any reason, is therefore problematic from a research ethics point of view. Such behaviour stands in the way of scientific progress. Interestingly, the issue of access to specimens is typically <a href="https://www.thefossilforum.com/topic/82439-publishing-research-on-fossils-in-private-collections/">discussed</a> when fossils are in private collections but the case of <em>X. calminechari</em> shows how this can affect specimens in public collections, too.</p> <h3 id="premature-description-of-new-species">Premature description of new species</h3> <p>Third and last, the reassessment study effectively charges Longrich et al. with sensationalism in their taxonomic work, claiming that tried to describe a new genus and species where there was insufficient scientific evidence for it. Especially in the context of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamata">squamates</a>, they criticise the practice of naming new species from tooth-based holotypes since the teeth of these animals might considerably converge across different species and diverge within the same species.</p> <blockquote> <p>To me, this reads like a valid criticism but I am not a scientist and will therefore not make myself the judge of this dispute. The same way I do not appreciate <a href="https://doi.org/10.55468/gc319">palaeontologists trying to explain what the law says</a>, I will not try and tell them what science says.</p> </blockquote> <p>What I will say is that I deeply respect reassessment studies such as the most recent one for <em>X. calminechari</em> or the one for the “four-legged snake.” To my mind, these form a crucial institution of scientific quality control—instead of chasing the next <em>gen. et spec. nov.</em></p> <hr/> <div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes"> <ol> <li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote"> <p>This might remind some readers about the seemingly never-ending debate on whether <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrannosaurus#Nanotyrannus">Nanotyrannus</a></em> is a distinct genus or a juvenile form of <em>T. rex</em>. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p> </li> </ol> </div>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="fossil-law"/><category term="fossil-forgery"/><category term="Morocco"/><category term="research-ethics"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The holotype specimen for this new mosasaur might have been forged - and there are legal doubts about its provenance.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Keeping Obsidian and MS Word in Sync with Pandoc</title><link href="https://paul-stewens.com/blog/2024/pandoc-conversion-loop/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Keeping Obsidian and MS Word in Sync with Pandoc"/><published>2024-12-26T06:03:12+00:00</published><updated>2024-12-26T06:03:12+00:00</updated><id>https://paul-stewens.com/blog/2024/pandoc-conversion-loop</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://paul-stewens.com/blog/2024/pandoc-conversion-loop/"><![CDATA[<blockquote> <p>This post details a solution for academic writing within my my personal knowledge management system using <strong>Obsidian</strong>. In case you’re unfamiliar with this free programme: <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> is a tool that allows you to edit and link locally stored <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/">Markdown</a> files.

Since late 2021, I do virtually all my academic writing in Obsidian.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> This is not the place to outline my entire workflow in detail but I will credit two fantastically detailed write-ups by <a href="https://martinezponciano.es/2021/04/05/research-workflow-as-a-phd-student-in-the-humanities/">Regina Martínez Ponciano</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211007182222/https://chris-grieser.de/a62298be91934043b11006be1ddc553a">Chris Grieser</a> which have helped me a great deal in developing it. I’ll just give a brief overview over the writing workflow per se to contextualise the solution I’m presenting here.</p> <p>Essentially, I rely on <strong><a href="https://pandoc.org/">Pandoc</a></strong>: a free software that converts a broad range of different text formats. For my academic uses, that typically involves <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.md</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.docx</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.pdf</code> but dozens of other formats are supported. Pandoc offers a broad range of functions which are set out in detail in its <a href="https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html">documentation</a>, including the rendering of citations, the use of formatting templates, and many, many more.</p> <p>Most of the time, I use Pandoc to convert an academic text that I have created in Obsidian in Markdown format into a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.docx</code> that I can send to collaborators, my supervisor, or submit to a journal. Pandoc uses a CLI (command line interface), or as we technically less averse individuals know it: the scary black screen with the white letters. Such a command will typically look something like this:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>pandoc --citeproc --reference-doc="template.docx" "paper.md" -s -o "paper.docx"
</code></pre></div></div> <p>This command instructs Pandoc to convert the file <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">paper.md</code> into the file <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">paper.docx</code>, to process the citations in the Markdown file, and to apply the format of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">template.docx</code> to the newly created document.</p> <p>For those seeking to avoid using the CLI, Olivier Balfour has developed the <strong><a href="https://github.com/OliverBalfour/obsidian-pandoc">Obsidian Pandoc Plugin</a></strong> which allows calling Pandoc from the command palette within Obsidian. This plugin also allows you to style an HTML output using CSS, or to add arguments like bibliographies or templates to the conversion command.</p> <h2 id="the-hassle-of-manual-conversion">The Hassle of Manual Conversion</h2> <p>Pandoc makes document conversion pretty smooth and effortless, especially once you’ve figured out the conversion command for the respective file. At that point, you can just keep converting it using the command palette, or re-using the same command on the CLI. But: You have to manually issue a command every time you want to convert your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.md</code> file into a Word document.</p> <p>This is something I’ve found increasingly cumbersome, particularly in contexts where I’m dealing with word counts or page counts. Here, I have no way of knowing exactly how many A4 pages a non-paginated <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.md</code> file will consist of, and Obsidian’s native word count is rather rudimentary and will not correspond to that of Microsoft Word after conversion.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> For example, when I was submitting assignments during my master’s that had a word limit of 2,000, I had to make sure that the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.docx</code> file would not have more than two thousand words as I was working on it. I quickly grew tired of manually converting the file over and over again so I thought of something.</p> <h2 id="syncing-obsidian-with-ms-word">Syncing Obsidian with MS Word</h2> <p>My solution consisted of creating a Windows batch file (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.bat</code>) that automatically executes the conversion command in a specific time interval. Here’s the code:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>cd "my_directory"
:start
timeout /t 60 /nobreak
pandoc --citeproc --reference-doc="template.docx" "paper.md" -s -o "paper.docx"
goto start
</code></pre></div></div> <p>When I execute the file, it first sets my working directory and then waits 60 seconds before having Pandoc convert my file. It then jumps back to right before the conversion command and again waits 60 seconds etc. until I manually cancel it using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Ctrl+C</code>. This solution since it keeps my <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.docx</code> file in sync while I’m working on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.md</code> file. The loop also keeps on running if Pandoc can’t overwrite the current <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.docx</code> file because it’s open. If you want to suppress the countdown that the Windows shell does by default, try putting this:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>timeout /t 60 /nobreak &gt; NUL
</code></pre></div></div> <p>An unaddressed shortcoming of this solution is that the terminal has to stay open in order to keep the script running and the files synced. However, the memory that it consumes seems negligible so its not much more than a potential visual annoyance on the screen.</p> <h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2> <p>This little script fixes an issue many/most people might not even encounter but for those who use or might be thinking of using Obsidian with Pandoc in a way similar to mine, this is a neat quality of life improvement that makes the academic writing experience just a little bit less tedious.</p> <h4 id="software-and-plugins-used">Software and Plugins Used</h4> <ul id="software-and-plugins" class="tab" data-tab="96f36ad4-ca39-4b5b-8f54-22b36c24480f" data-name="software-and-plugins"> <li class="active" id="software-and-plugins-software"> <a href="#">Software </a> </li> <li id="software-and-plugins-plugins"> <a href="#">Plugins </a> </li> </ul> <ul class="tab-content" id="96f36ad4-ca39-4b5b-8f54-22b36c24480f" data-name="software-and-plugins"> <li class="active"> <ul> <li>Obsidian</li> <li>Pandoc</li> <li>Microsoft Word</li> </ul> </li> <li> <ul> <li>Obsidian Pandoc Plugin</li> <li>Obsidian Better Word Count Plugin</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <hr/> <h4 id="footnotes">Footnotes</h4> <div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes"> <ol> <li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote"> <p>The chief exception are co-authored publications for which I have not yet found a sufficient collaborative functionality within Obsidian. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p> </li> <li id="fn:2" role="doc-endnote"> <p>Note, however, that there is a <a href="https://github.com/lukeleppan/better-word-count">Better Word Count plugin</a>. <a href="#fnref:2" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p> </li> </ol> </div>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="PKMS"/><category term="academic-writing"/><category term="Obsidian"/><category term="Pandoc"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Annoyed by having to manually convert your .md file over and over again?

In case you’re unfamiliar with these two free programmes: <a href="https://www.zotero.org/">Zotero</a> is a reference manager, and <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> is a tool that allows you to edit and link locally stored <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/">Markdown</a> files. For a more thorough introduction, check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUrOfIqvGS4">this video</a>.</p> </blockquote> <h2 id="what-are-citations-keys-and-why-bother">What Are Citations Keys, and Why Bother?</h2> <p>When I started using Obsidian as a personal knowledge management system, I soon wanted to move my academic writing there, too. The distraction-free editor and the prospect of minimising my contact with Microsoft Word were as appealing back then as they are now. Like many of Obsidian’s more advanced uses, how to do this wasn’t all that evident to me as someone without a very strong technical background. It only really clicked for me when I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J86Pm62XM_Q">this amazing tutorial</a> which I cannot recommend enough for anyone looking to get into academic writing in Obsidian.</p> <p>This post is not the place to go into depth about the writing workflow. I’ll only say that much: <a href="https://pandoc.org/">Pandoc</a> is a programme that converts <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.md</code> files into a broad range of different formats, among them <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.docx</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.html.</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.pdf</code>. It comes with a feature called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">citeproc</code> which, as the name suggests, allows processing/rendering citations in accordance with a specified citation style and based on a specified bibliography in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.bib</code> format.</p> <p>Importantly, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">citeproc</code> relies on a specific element of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.bib</code> files to select the right bibliographic information to render the citations: the so-called <strong>citation key</strong>. This is an identifier that is unique for each <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.bib</code> file and can have all sorts of different formats. It sits in the beginning of each entry and allows <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">citeproc</code> to call the correct information from a bibliography.</p> <p>This was the first time I have ever been in touch with citation keys, and over time I have come to use them more and more for reference management and writing in Obsidian. This post showcases these uses, and highlights the potential of citation keys that might enhance your Second Brain, too.</p> <h2 id="generating-citation-keys">Generating Citation Keys</h2> <p>All reference managers that come with a citation processor work based on citation keys but the exact formats differ. Some programmes even allow you to customize your citation keys, for instance <a href="https://www1.citavi.com/sub/manual6/en/index.html?cse_customizing_citation_keys.html">Citavi 6</a>. Zotero does not allow you to change the rules according to which citation keys are generated natively. There is, however, a plugin for that: <strong><a href="https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/">BetterBibTex</a></strong>. This is a solution that adds a number of functions to Zotero (and Juris-M, another reference manager) of which two are interesting here.</p> <p>First, <a href="https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/citing/index.html">custom citation keys</a>. Frankly, I just use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">zotero.clean</code> pre-set formula which effectively takes the surname of the first author, the first ‘real’ word of the title (which is not an article or a preposition), and the year of publication, all separated by underscores (e.g., <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ahrens_how_2022</code>). That being said, you have a broad range of customisation options if you prefer any other format. BetterBibTex also ensures that citation keys are unique across your entire Zotero library.</p> <p>Second, <a href="https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/exporting/index.html">advanced export features</a>. BetterBibTex makes it possible to keep exporting your library as a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.bib</code> file to a directory of your choice, and in intervals/upon triggers of your choice - quietly in the background. My full library gets exported every time I change something, to a folder within my Obsidian vault. That allows having a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.bib</code> file that contains all your references and is always up to date with your vault to use for various purposes.</p> <p>What are these purposes, you ask? Keep reading…</p> <h2 id="using-citation-keys-i-file-management">Using Citation Keys I: File Management</h2> <p>Before we move into the Obsidian vault, I’d like to highlight another plugin for Zotero which makes my life a lot easier: <strong><a href="https://zotfile.com/">Zotfile</a></strong>. Storing bibliographical information in Zotero is all fine and well but you will often want a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.pdf</code> alongside that information. Zotfile is here to help with the management of attachments in your Zotero library. The essential functionality for me is the “Rename and move”-feature which, unsurprisingly, allows you to automatically rename an attachment to a given reference in accordance with a custom rule and to move it to a custom directory.</p> <p>My custom directory is the Attachments folder within my vault. For the file names, I have set up Zotfile in a way that renames the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.pdf</code> attachments with the citation key of the reference that they’re attached to. To achieve this, open the ZotFile preferences and go to the “Renaming Rules” tab. Once here, go to the field “Format for all Item Types except Patents” and simply put <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{%b}</code>.</p> <p>Now, you can select any reference, right click, select the “Manage Attachments” option and click “Rename and move”. The attached <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.pdf</code> will be moved to the directory you specified and rename to the citation key. You can do this for single references but bulk renaming and moving is possible, too.</p> <p>Even regardless of the renaming functionality, the bulk moving to another directory might be interesting for users with files that add up to more than the 300 MB of free storage that Zotero offers its users. Simply move your attachments to another folder that you’re syncing with a cloud and you’re good to go!</p> <h2 id="using-citation-keys-ii-reference-notes-in-obsidian">Using Citation Keys II: Reference Notes in Obsidian</h2> <p>Let’s start looking into Obsidian. Here, the key plugin that works with citation keys is called <strong><a href="https://github.com/hans/obsidian-citation-plugin/">Obsidian Citations Plugin</a></strong>. Once you specify the path of your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.bib</code> bibliography, the plugin allows you to create notes for specific references from your Zotero. Select <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Citations: Open literature note</code> from the command pane, and the plugin will load your bibliography and allow you to select a reference to create a note for.</p> <p>In the plugin settings, you can specify the template for such a reference note. Importantly, the variables to choose from include <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{{citekey}}</code> which I use for the file title of the reference note: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@{{citekey}}</code>. Here, it also comes in handy that I used ZotFile to rename the attached <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.pdf</code> files to the citation key: I can exploit it for the template.</p> <ul> <li>If you want, say, to embed the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.pdf</code> in your reference note, simply put <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">![[{{citekey}}.pdf]]</code> in your template.</li> <li>I’m using the <strong><a href="https://github.com/elias-sundqvist/obsidian-annotator">Obsidian Annotator</a></strong> plugin to highlight my documents. This plugin requires frontmatter information which specifies the annotation target. So, I simply put <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">annotation-target:: "006 Attachments/{{citekey}}.pdf"</code> at the top of my template and I can start annotating immediately upon the creation of my note.</li> </ul> <p>The Obsidian Citations Plugin lets you specify a folder in which your reference notes will be created but just in case, you could also use <strong><a href="https://github.com/farux/obsidian-auto-note-mover">Obsidian Auto Note Mover</a></strong> and add a rule that all files whose name begins with an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@</code> are to be moved to a given folder.</p> <h2 id="using-citation-keys-iii-writing-with-citations">Using Citation Keys III: Writing with Citations</h2> <p>I’ve briefly explained how to produce academic text with references in Obsidian and have them rendered with Pandoc. Here, the Obsidian Citations plugin comes in handy as well. Select <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Citations: Insert Markdown citation</code> and the plugin will let you select a reference and subsequently put a Markdown citation, i.e., the citation key prefixed with an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@</code> in between square brackets.</p> <p>The fact that this is also the format I have chosen for my reference notes means that whenever I open a reference note, all citations of that reference in my own writing within Obsidian will show up under the Unlinked mentions. This is a neat way of keeping track of how I’ve used a reference in my writing.</p> <h2 id="using-citation-keys-iv-bulk-processing-notes-with-python">Using Citation Keys IV: Bulk Processing Notes with Python</h2> <p>Consistently using standardised citation keys can also be a lifesaver when you’re working on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.md</code> files in your vault with an app other than Obsidian. This might not be the case very often but the fact that this is possible is a central pillar of why Obsidian is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/q7aimp/how_futureproof_is_in_fact_obsidian/">considered</a> a relatively future-proof way of storing your notes.</p> <p>Here is a recent use-case of mine. I used to tag every note generated using the Obsidian Citations plugin with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#reference</code>. However, a friend of mine recently introduced me to a tagging system that was too genius not to implement it. Among other things, it entails nested tags to distinguish different types of resources (e.g., <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#is/resource/book</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#is/resource/paper</code> and so on). The problem: I had over 900 reference notes which I totally wasn’t going to re-tag manually, and I couldn’t use <strong><a href="https://github.com/pjeby/tag-wrangler">Obsidian Tag Wrangler</a></strong> because <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#reference</code> had to be split up into different tags based on the type of reference.</p> <p>So, I started by sorting my Zotero library by item type, selected all my books, and exported them as a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">books.bib</code> bibliography. Then, I asked ChatGPT to generate a Python script that would allow me to replace <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#reference</code> with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#is/resource/book</code> - but only for those notes whose file title (i.e., the citation key) was contained in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">books.bib</code>. This worked like a charm, and I repeated it for the other item types that got their own specific tag under the new system. So, yet another case where I got to exploit a structure I had long ago put in place for an entirely different purpose.</p> <h2 id="bonus-using-citation-keys-v-harmonising-citations-keys-with-obsidian-web-clipper">[Bonus] Using Citation Keys V: Harmonising Citations Keys with Obsidian Web Clipper</h2> <p>This fall, Obsidian made its browser plugin <strong><a href="https://obsidian.md/clipper">Obsidian Web Clipper</a></strong> available to all users who are now able to highlight and clip all sorts of online resources directly into their vault. I think this yet another amazing feature which the Obsidian developers have released and I can’t wait to play around with it a bit more.</p> <p>It does however, come with a little challenge to the citation key-based workflow. Obsidian Web Clipper cannot tap into the citation keys generated within Zotero, it only communications between my browser and my vault. Accordingly, clipping online content may create reference notes in my vault that are not named with the corresponding citation key.</p> <p>So, after clipping the reference and automatically creating a reference note in my vault, I add the reference to my Zotero using the <strong><a href="https://www.zotero.org/download/">Zotero Connector</a></strong> browser integration. Now, I have a reference with a citation key in Zotero, and an incorrectly named reference note in my vault.</p> <p>For the next step, I wrestled with ChatGPT for quite a while until I managed to modify the Obsidian Citations plugin to add a new function that allows me to select a reference to whose citation key the active file should be renamed. I execute that command, select the correct reference, and the title generated by Obsidian Web Clipper is replaced by the citation key.</p> <p>This is a homemade solution, and I am afraid I lack the technical capabilities to make a pull request to the plugin’s GitHub repository for this to become an actual feature - which only adds to the hesitation I have based on the fact that AI modified the code of the plugin, not me. If you’re still interested in me sharing this modified plugin with you, please <a href="mailto:paulphilippstewens@gmail.com">reach out</a> to me directly.</p> <h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2> <p>Over time, I have discovered an ever-wider range of opportunities to exploit my use of citation keys which I totally did not have in mind when I first started using them to name my reference notes. I think these use cases that have emerged over the years show that consistency pays off: in the sense that you never know what a given structural feature could be useful for in the future. After all, you might not have to re-invent the wheel even in times of more expansive re-structuring; finding creative uses for the structure you already have might just be enough at times.</p> <h4 id="software-and-plugins-used">Software and Plugins Used</h4> <ul id="software" class="tab" data-tab="39e0dbe7-fbef-47f2-9e45-8414cf6d11b5" data-name="software"> <li class="active" id="software-obsidian"> <a href="#">Obsidian </a> </li> <li id="software-zotero"> <a href="#">Zotero </a> </li> <li id="software-pandoc"> <a href="#">Pandoc </a> </li> </ul> <ul class="tab-content" id="39e0dbe7-fbef-47f2-9e45-8414cf6d11b5" data-name="software"> <li class="active"> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>- Citations
