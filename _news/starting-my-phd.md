I'm officially a PhD researcher now!

---

After being in the lucky position of the first day of my contract being a holiday, I've now officially embarked on my **PhD journey at Maastricht University**. The Faculty is still a quiet place during these first days of January, which gives me plenty of calm to settle in, get my first ever work laptop up and running, update my [personal profile on the UM website](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/pp-stewens), and slowly begin to create the routines that will structure my professional life for the next four years. Already having spent a few months at the Faculty two and a half years back comes in really handy now.

I wholeheartedly look forward to what's ahead of me, and I couldn't be more grateful that what has been a pastime for several years now has become my full-time job: thinking about dinosaurs and the law.

**The call for dinosaur law PhDs has been heard.**
