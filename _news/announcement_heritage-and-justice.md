        <p>The <strong>Center for the Humanities of Nature</strong> at the Museum für Naturkunde Berlin does a lot of trailblazing research: often on the colonial provenance of natural history collections, and often on other important subjects which demonstrate that natural history does not exist within a vacuum but amidst many of those issues we're only used to discussing in the context of ethnographical museums. One of their numerous activities is hosting an online lecture series titled <strong>"Heritage and Justice: Unpacking Legal Narratives in Natural History."</strong> It started a few days ago and will keep running throughout Q1 of 2025; a full programme can be found <a href="https://www.museumfuernaturkunde.berlin/en/science/center-humanities-nature">here</a>.</p>
        <p>I was most pleased to learn about this lecture series through an invitation by the organisers to speak at the March session, about restitution claims for fossils. It was just as great of a pleasure to accept, and to be able to invite everyone to <a href="/assets/ics/MfN-talk.ics">save the date</a> for my talk titled <strong>"Distinction Without a Difference? Natural vs. Cultural Heritage in the Spotlight of Restitution Claims"</strong> on 12 March 2025 at 1.00 pm (GMT+1). If you're interested in joining the series, please make sure to register via <a href="mailto:humanities@mfn.berlin">humanities@mfn.berlin</a>.</p>
