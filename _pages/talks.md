        <p>Communicating the results of my research is a cornerstone of how I understand my role as an academic. I enjoy sharing my findings, thoughts, opinions, and arguments with others: be it colleagues from the same or adjacent disciplines, researchers that work in different fields, university students, or the general public. Throughout my academic career, I've actively sought opportunities to present my work, and this page brings together some highlights with a full record of the talks and presentations I've been delivering over the years.</p>

<h2 id="tedx-talk">TEDx Talk "Your Favourite Dinosaur Might Be Stolen"</h2>
During my master's at the Geneva Graduate Institute, I got to be part of the **2023 TED<sup>x</sup>GVAGrad conference**, titled ["Rethink Realities"](https://tedxgvagrad.com/2023-rethink-realities). Upon a successful application to be a speaker for the [student corner](https://tedxgvagrad.com/2023-student-speakers), I not only got the chance to speak to an auditorium full of people to dinosaur theft, but also public speaking and speechwriting training beforehand to make sure I could do so as effectively as possible.

The result, my talk **"Your Favourite Dinosaur Might Be Stolen"**, has been viewed over 23,000 times (as of January 2025), making it the second most popular one from the conference and the third most popular in the history of TED<sup>x</sup>GVAGrad. It's a fun watch of well under six minutes' duration and the most accessible introduction into what I'm doing academically and why I think it matters. So, I'd be delighted if you gave it a watch!

<h2 id="mnhn-lecture">lecture "A Tale of Two Museums"</h2>
In [June 2025](/news/lecture-mnhn/), I was fortunate enough to be part of the seminar "*Muséums et enjeux contemporains. Quels discours sur les collections d'histoire naturelle ?*". For six months, this series of lectures brought different researchers to the *Muséum National d'Histoire Naturelle* in Paris to speak about issues such as provenance research, colonial legacies, and restitution in the context of natural history museums. In about an hour, I explain why restitution is not as common of a topic in the natural history world, and why this should change. I discuss the relevant legal framework, its potential and shortcomings, and lots of examples of natural history objects or collections of problematic provenance. 

The organisers were kind enough to record the lecture and the Q&A, so it's here for you to watch. I hope you will find it insightful---and if your question wasn't asked during the Q&A, please [send me an e-mail](mailto:paul.stewens@maastrichtuniversity.nl) and I'll be happy to discuss it with you!
