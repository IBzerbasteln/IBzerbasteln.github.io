Welcome to my website! I'm a [PhD researcher](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/pp-stewens) with the Faculty of Law at Maastricht University and work on **all legal questions that surround dinosaur fossils and other palaeontological objects**. [My research interests](/projects-and-interests/) include:

- the extraction, ownership, and international movement of fossils;
- the restitution of looted or stolen fossils;
- the delimitation between cultural and natural artifacts;
- the legal classification of fossilised human remains;
- and many more.

My work mostly results in academic [publications](/publications/) but I've contributed my specialist expertise to more accessible outlets as well, including an [op-ed](https://undark.org/2024/04/25/opinion-academic-publishers-ukrainian-fossils-theft/) for _Undark Magazine_, a [podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/16Qnd9HLb5P6zoeBqEov5l?si=52941a7a395843f6), and a [TEDx talk](/talks#tedx-talk/).

Prior to coming to Maastricht, I graduated from the Geneva Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies with a Master in International Law. I also hold an undergraduate degree in International Relations from Technische Universit√§t Dresden.

        <p>During my time in Geneva, I got to be a speaker for the <a href="https://tedxgvagrad.com/2023-student-speakers">student corner</a> of the 2023 TED<sup>x</sup>GVAGrad conference titled <a href="https://tedxgvagrad.com/2023-rethink-realities">Rethink Realities</a>. My talk <strong>"Your Favourite Dinosaur Might Be Stolen"</strong> is a fun watch of well under six minutes' duration and the most accessible introduction into what I'm doing academically and why I think it matters. So, I'd be delighted if you gave it a watch!</p>
