Welcome to my website! I'm a [PhD researcher](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/pp-stewens) with the Faculty of Law at Maastricht University and work on **all legal questions that surround dinosaur fossils and other palaeontological objects**. Issues that concern me include:
- the extraction, ownership, and international movement of fossils;
- the restitution of looted or stolen fossils;
- the delimitation between cultural and natural artifacts; 
- the legal classification of fossilised human remains;
- and many more.

My work mostly results in academic [publications](/publications/) but I've contributed my specialist expertise to more accessible outlets as well, including an [op-ed](https://undark.org/2024/04/25/opinion-academic-publishers-ukrainian-fossils-theft/) for *Undark Magazine*, a [podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/16Qnd9HLb5P6zoeBqEov5l?si=52941a7a395843f6), and a [TEDx talk](https://youtu.be/pVf-5-Jl41s?) with over 20,000 views. 

Prior to coming to Maastricht, I graduated from the Geneva Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies with a Master in International Law. I also hold an undergraduate degree in International Relations from Technische Universit√§t Dresden.
