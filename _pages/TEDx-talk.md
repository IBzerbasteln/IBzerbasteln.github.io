During my master's at the Geneva Graduate Institute, I got to be part of the **2023 TED<sup>x</sup>GVAGrad conference**, titled ["Rethink Realities"](https://tedxgvagrad.com/2023-rethink-realities). Upon a successful application to be a speaker for the [student corner](https://tedxgvagrad.com/2023-student-speakers), I not only got the chance to speak to an auditorium full of people to dinosaur theft, but also public speaking and speechwriting training beforehand to make sure I could do so as effectively as possible.

The result, my talk **"Your Favourite Dinosaur Might Be Stolen"**, has been viewed over 23,000 times (as of January 2025), making it the second most popular one from the conference and the third most popular in the history of TED<sup>x</sup>GVAGrad. It's a fun watch of well under six minutes' duration and probably the most accessible introduction into what I'm doing academically and why I think it matters. So, I'd be delighted if you gave it a watch!
