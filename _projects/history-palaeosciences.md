        <p>Humans have interacted with the deep past since prehistoric times. Only recently, in 2024, Brazilian researchers <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-56479-3">described</a> a site where pre-colonial native populations had left petroglyphs right next to, and in association with, fossilised dinosaur footprints. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352409X17305485?via%3Dihub">Other archaeological evidence</a> points to deliberate fossil collection by the Maya people and perhaps <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2571-550X/7/4/49">even by Neanderthals</a>; fossils are assumed to have inspired myths and folklore in <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00155870701806225">India</a>, the <a href="https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/9781400838448/html">Mediterranean</a>, and <a href="https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/9781400849314/html">North America</a>.</p>
        <p>During the rise of Western natural science, the fossil record played an essential role for the development of the theory of evolution, the study of human origins, and the replacement of Biblical and creationist accounts with an awareness for the deep past of our planet. In this pursuit, Western naturalists often benefited from the opportunities which the domination of foreign territories and populations afforded them for the collection of specimens; be it under overseas colonialism, internal colonialism, or military occupation. Scientists studying human evolution often propagated racial science that was often increasingly receptive to the theory evolution but placed non-white populations into an inferior, "more primitive" stage of evolution which white Europeans had exceeded.</p>

I am curious about the history of the palaeosciences:

1.  from a **paradigmatic** standpoint that zooms in on our ideas about the history of life on this planet and our own species at a given time, and how they themselves evolve;
2.  from a **critical** standpoint that inquires about the embeddedness of what are often considered neutral, apolitical sciences in social and political struggles; and
3.  from a **legal history** standpoint that studies the historical development of regulation concerning objects of palaeontological interest in light of their larger context in a given historical moment.

Among other things, I am a member of the **[Popularizing Palaeontology network](http://www.poppalaeo.com/)** which brings together historians of science, palaeontologists, and palaeoartists to study the reception of the palaeosciences in public audiences.
