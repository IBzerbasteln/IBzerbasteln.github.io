    	<p>The inevitability of death has prompted a broad range of responses across cultures, societies, and religions as to what (if anything) comes after death and how to treat the physical remains of a deceased person. This facet of the human condition is so essential that societies often rely on the force of the law to enforce the values and sensitivities which have emerged surrounding the remains of those who have passed away.
        </p>
        <p>Here, we can observe a highly diversified (some might call it fragmented) legal regime that contains different restrictions depending on how close the human remains in question are to our immediate present. The remains of individual who are recently deceased are often protected with the objective of safeguarding that individual's dignity even <em>post mortem</em> (e.g., during <a href="https://www.icrc.org/sites/default/files/document/file_list/last_version_200583_respect_for_and_protection_of_the_dead_final.pdf">armed conflict</a>) or the interests of their relatives. That link, however, becomes increasingly tenuous the more time has passed since the death of the individual. Here, the motive for legal protection might emanate from an <a href="https://doi.org/10.4324/9780203838716">archaeological interest</a> in the preservation of the remains or, typically in the context of indigenous communities, the desire to protect <a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/S0940739124000067">ancestral remains</a>. Once we go even further back, these motivations might progressively fade, too, as we move into the prehistoric era and the remains of early <em>Homo sapiens</em>. Their protection and preservation might be chiefly driven by a scientific concern to make these remains available for palaeoanthropologists to study. And if we cast the widest net possible, we might even include the remains of other species from the genus <em>Homo</em> within the scope of human remains: <em>H. neanderthalensis</em>, <em>H. erectus</em>, <em>H. heidelbergensis</em> and so on. And ultimately, what about other hominins like the australopithecines?</p>

                <strong>Kabwe 1</strong>, also known as the Broken Hill skull, belongs to a <i>Homo heidelbergensis</i> specimen and is the subject of a repatriation controversy between Zambia and the United Kingdom. Most recently, Zambia has claimed that Kabwe 1 represented ancestral remains of the local Zambian population and as such had to be repatriated.

Here, we can observe a highly diversified (some might call it fragmented) legal regime that contains different restrictions depending on how close the human remains in question are to our immediate present. The remains of individual who are recently deceased are often protected with the objective of safeguarding that individual's dignity even _post mortem_ (e.g., during [armed conflict](https://www.icrc.org/sites/default/files/document/file_list/last_version_200583_respect_for_and_protection_of_the_dead_final.pdf)) or the interests of their relatives. That link, however, becomes increasingly tenuous the more time has passed since the death of the individual. Here, the motive for legal protection might emanate from an [archaeological interest](<[https://doi.org/10.4324/9780203838716](https://doi.org/10.4324/9780203838716)>) in the preservation of the remains or, typically in the context of indigenous communities, the desire to protect [ancestral remains](<[https://doi.org/10.1017/S0940739124000067](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0940739124000067)>). Once we go even further back, these motivations might progressively fade, too, as we move into the prehistoric era and the remains of early _Homo sapiens_. Their protection and preservation might be chiefly driven by a scientific concern to make these remains available for palaeoanthropologists to study. And if we cast the widest net possible, we might even include the remains of other species from the genus _Homo_ within the scope of human remains: _H. neanderthalensis_, _H. erectus_, _H. heidelbergensis_ and so on. And ultimately, what about other hominins like the australopithecines?

This interplay between our cultural conceptions and normative convictions surrounding death on the one hand, and their enforcement through law on the other hand fascinates me. To me, it begs a broad range of intriguing questions such as:

- Where do we draw the line between distinct categories of human remains? Or, more provocatively: How much times needs to pass after death before a disturbance of the dead turns into an archaeological excavation?
- Where do we draw the line between human remains and other categories of artifacts that enjoy special protection by law? When do human remains turn into "mere" antiquities, or items of scientific interest?
- What is "human" about human remains? Does it go beyond _Homo sapiens_ and cover human ancestors as well? Does it only cover modern humans?

I think human remains represent a type of objects that challenges legal classification---not least to the heavy normative underpinnings of the relevant legal regimes. It is this sort of friction that I am interested in: regarding human remains, and with respect to [palaeontological objects](/projects/legal-regulation-of-palaeontology) which are the focus of my doctoral research.
